Lending Club Machine Learning Prediction (Kaggle Project)

Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model for predicting whether loan applicants are likely to default or not based on their profiles. By leveraging past loan application data from LendingClub, the model aims to assist in making informed decisions regarding loan approvals, minimizing potential financial losses, and optimizing business outcomes.

Key Features

Problem Statement: LendingClub, a leading urban lender, faces the challenge of making accurate decisions on loan approvals to mitigate risks associated with defaulting applicants while maximizing business opportunities.

Data Description

The dataset contains historical loan application data, including applicant profiles and loan status (fully paid, charged-off, current).

Objective

The primary goal is to identify patterns within the applicant profiles that indicate whether a person is likely to default on their loan, facilitating actions such as loan denial, risk-based pricing, or higher interest rates.

Decision Types:
1.Loan Accepted
-Fully Paid: Applicants who have successfully repaid the loan, including principal and interest.
-Charged-off: Applicants who have defaulted on their loan by not paying instalments for an extended period.
-Current: Applicants in the process of paying instalments, excluded from analysis as their loan tenure is ongoing.

2.Loan Rejected: Applicants who did not meet the company's requirements and were denied a loan.
Machine Learning Approach: Utilizing supervised learning techniques, the project aims to train predictive models on historical loan data to classify new applicants as likely to default or not.

Model Evaluation: The performance of the trained models will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure robustness and effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

Potential Actions: Based on the model predictions, LendingClub can take various actions, including:
Adjusting loan approval criteria.
Implementing risk-based pricing strategies.
Offering alternative financial products.
Enhancing customer screening processes.
